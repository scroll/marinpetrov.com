about-author: I am currently working as a product manager, facilitator and coach and care deeply about the invisible, but important ingredients that make high-performing teams. I was very fortunate to have worked at one of the best animation studios in the world on features like "Ice Age", "Rio", "Ferdinand" and many more. I also co-founded a remote self-managed VR Game Studio and a remote self-managed software company called RGBNotes, which was later acquired by Amazon. # add description
